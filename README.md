# area42

compiler dsl

## parser

the first mini-dsl of area42

goals:

* easy to read, not very *magical*
* good interop with next area42 dsl-s
* generation of correct, but very simple parsers
* non-optimized output: for optimized use other speedy libs
* maybe: generate parsers in various languages one day based on the same nim dsl

## next

TODO
